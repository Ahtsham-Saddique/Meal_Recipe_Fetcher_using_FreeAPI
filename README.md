This is a simple Python script that fetches meal recipe data from the FreeAPI using a meal ID. It retrieves the meal name, cooking instructions, and a neatly formatted list of ingredients with their respective measurements.

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

    API integration in Python

    JSON data parsing

    Handling dynamic keys (like strIngredient1 to strIngredient20)

    Error handling in basic API requests
